description: Antelope is a community-led blockchain protocol that has forked from EOSIO 2.0. It is an open framework for building fast, secure, next-generation decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 services. Antelope has been created through a coalition of four EOSIO protocol-based blockchains (EOS, Telos, WAX, and UX Network). These chains share Antelope's underlying blockchain codebase and work together to accelerate the development of the core protocol. With its public Github repository and website, Antelope introduces a more advanced framework as an independent blockchain.

## Benefits of Antelope being a community-led protocol

As a community-led protocol, Antelope offers several benefits:

1. **Decentralization**: Antelope is decentralized, ensuring that no single entity controls the protocol. This promotes transparency and enhances security.

2. **Collaboration**: Antelope is developed by a coalition of EOSIO protocol-based blockchains, including EOS, Telos, WAX, and UX Network. This collaboration fosters continuous improvement and evolution of the core protocol.

3. **User-centric Approach**: Antelope is built by its users, for its users. The community has a say in the protocol's development, ensuring that it meets their needs and requirements.

4. **Advanced Framework**: Antelope's SDKs and scalability provide web3 developers with an opportunity to build dApps on a highly advanced protocol. The focus on technical improvements and creating a useful blockchain architecture benefits everyone involved.

5. **Low-cost Accessibility**: Antelope aims to be a low-cost, open framework and high-throughput blockchain. It enables anyone interested in creating and publishing next-generation web3 services and dApps to participate.

## Examples of decentralized applications that can be built on Antelope

Antelope provides an open framework for building various decentralized applications, including:

- DeFi protocols
- NFT platforms
- Blockchain games
- Supply chain management solutions
- Social media platforms
- Identity verification systems

With its decentralized and user-centric approach, Antelope empowers developers to create innovative dApps that leverage the advanced features and scalability of the protocol.
